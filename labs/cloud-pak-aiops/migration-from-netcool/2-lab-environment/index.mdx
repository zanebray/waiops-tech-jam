In this Lab, you will have access to one OpenShift cluster via a bastion virtual
machine that has installed Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Note that inside
OpenShift, the cluster has installed the Cloud Pak for AIOps. It also has
installed the Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) which is a
software-defined, container-native storage solution that provides storage
classes that will be used by the Cloud Pak for AIOps to dynamically request
storage.

The following diagram describes the infrastructure for the Lab:

:::note

There is also a regular virtual machine present that has Netcool/OMNIbus and
Netcool/Impact installed. A Simnet Probe is running and feeding a stream of
events into Netcool/OMNIbus. The Netcool assets on this virtual machine will be
used in this lab.

## 2.4: Lab Data Cleanup

If you have just provisioned a new lab environment from TechZone, you can skip this section.

Otherwise, if this environment has been used for a previous lab, **ask the Lab Instructor** if you need to remove any leftover configuration and data
before you proceed with the lab exercises. If you need to do a cleanup, follow the steps below. 

### Integrations Cleanup

From the burger menu in the top-left navigate to: **Define → Integrations**. 
Delete all integrations listed. To delete an integration: 
Select the integration type, and click on the trash can icon on the right, on the popup dialog type the integration name and click on **Delete**

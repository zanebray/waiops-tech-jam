In this lab, you will initially connect to a bastion virtual machine that has Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) installed on it from which you will carry out the tasks outlined in the instructions. Once you have finished your installation, you will open a Firefox browser on this bastion host and log in to your newly installed AIOps instance.

In your environment, you will also have a set of ten Linux virtual machines installed with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4. The specification and eventual use of these machines will be as follows:

* 1 x proxy server - 4 CPU, 16 Gi RAM, 300 Gi disk
* 3 x control plane nodes - 16 CPU 32 Gi RAM, 300 Gi disk + (2 x 300 Gi disks)
* 6 x worker nodes - 16 CPU, 64 Gi RAM, 300 Gi disk + (1 x 300 Gi disk)

:::note

A Netcool server is also set up for you to use in subsequent labs.

:::

During the course of this lab, you will set up and install a proxy server and then run the installation of AIOps from that same box.

:::note

One key objective of this Lab is to expose the product public documentation to
the practitioners. With this in mind, each installation steps will reference the
product documentation.
